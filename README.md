Climax is the "Electron for CLI applications", and even more than that:

:white_square_button: **CLI-based Development:** Exactly as serious frameworks do, we provide a CLI allowing you to generate (almost) everything. Fun fact: this CLI utilize Climax itself. We eat our own :hamburger:s.<br>
:computer: **Easy Cross-Platform Building:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.<br>
:arrows_counterclockwise: **Out-of-the-box Auto-Updates:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).<br>
:page_facing_up: **Conventions:** We provide a set of conventions regarding your CLI architecture in order to remove the pain of looking around for some.
